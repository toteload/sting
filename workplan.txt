[ ] bvh, with triangles
[ ] fps counter / ms per frame (using imgui maybe?)

[ ] depth buffer output
[ ] normal buffer output
[ ] quad bvh

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] add functionality to have the render buffer size and the screen size
    to be different dimensions

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] add triangle intersection
[x] point lights, with shadow casts and simple lambertian shading
[x] point camera
[x] a buffer for the raytracer to write results to, then every frame
    this buffer gets read from and written to the screen, basically an
    accumulator
[x] rays with sphere intersection, without camera just shoot straight
    ahead
[x] add interactive camera controls
[x] create a window without opengl
[x] add opengl context
[x] setup rendering code for drawing a texture across the whole screen
[x] add cuda test code that writes to a texture
[x] setup cuda opengl interop
